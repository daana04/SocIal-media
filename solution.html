                      <strong>Use an app to track how much time you spend on social media each day.</strong> Then set a goal for how much you want to reduce it by.<br>
                      <strong>Turn off your phone at certain times of the day.</strong> such as when you’re driving, in a meeting, at the gym, having dinner, spending time with offline friends, or playing with your kids. Don’t take your phone with you to the bathroom.<br>
                      <strong>Don’t bring your phone or tablet to bed.</strong> Turn devices off and leave them in another room overnight to charge.<br>
                      <strong>Limit checks.</strong> If you compulsively check your phone every few minutes, wean yourself off by limiting your checks to once every 15 minutes. Then once every 30 minutes, then once an hour. There are apps that can automatically limit when you’re able to access your phone.<br>

                      <strong>Are you using social media as a substitute for real life?</strong> Is there a healthier substitute for your social media use? If you’re lonely, for example, invite a friend out for coffee instead. Feeling depressed? Take a walk or go to the gym. Bored? Take up a new hobby. Social media may be quick and convenient, but there are often healthier, more effective ways to satisfy a craving.<br>
                      <strong>Does social media leave you feeling inadequate or disappointed about your life? </strong> You can counter symptoms of FOMO by focusing on what you have, rather than what you lack. Make a list of all the positive aspects of your life and read it back when you feel you’re missing out on something better. And remember: no one’s life is ever as perfect as it seems on social media. We all deal with heartache, self-doubt, and disappointment, even if we choose not to share it online.

                      <strong>Set aside time each week</strong>to interact offline with friends and family. Try to make it a regular get-together where you always keep your phones off.<br>
                      <strong>If you’ve neglected face-to-face friendships, reach out to an old friend</strong>(or an online friend) and arrange to meet up. If you both lead busy lives, offer to run errands or exercise together.<br>
                      <strong>If you don’t feel that you have anyone to spend time with, reach out to acquaintances. </strong>Lots of other people feel just as uncomfortable about making new friends as you do—so be the one to break the ice. Invite a coworker out for lunch or ask a neighbor or classmate to join you for coffee.

                      <div class="accordion-body">
                        <strong>Take time for reflection.</strong>Try keeping a gratitude journal or using a gratitude app. Keep track of all the great memories and positives in your life—as well as those things and people you’d miss if they were suddenly absent from your life. If you’re more prone to venting or negative posts, you can even express your gratitude on social media—although you may benefit more from private reflection that isn’t subject to the scrutiny of others. <br>
                        <strong>Practice mindfulness.</strong>Experiencing FOMO and comparing yourself unfavorably to others keeps you dwelling on life’s disappointments and frustrations. Instead of being fully engaged in the present, you’re focused on the “what ifs” and the “if onlys” that prevent you from having a life that matches those you see on social media. By practicing mindfulness, you can learn to live more in the present moment, lessen the impact of FOMO, and improve your overall mental wellbeing.<br>
                        <strong>Volunteer.  </strong>Just as human beings are hard-wired to seek social connection, we’re also hard-wired to give to others. Helping other people or animals not only enriches your community and benefits a cause that’s important to you, but it also makes you feel happier and more grateful.
